Classification
Doing Classification on the Titanic dataset aand finding correlation between 2 colomuns.
Finding the accuracy by using Navive Bayes method.
I found Bernoulli Navive bayes classifier best fits the data as the classification is based on the Survived column which is binary(0,1).

And Part-2 is about best classification for Glass dataset,
as there are different types of glass which is not binary so Gaussian Naive Bayes is best fits for the classification.
I also compared with Linear Support Vector Machine(SVM), yeilding accuracy of 0.72.
Where Gaussian Naive Bayes best yeilding accuracy of 0.83.
